Is UK police bias on traffic stops and search drivers by racism**

Firstly, traffic stops reasons are checked and results that the top violation of traffic stop is moving violation then equipment and so on as shown blow. Driving under the influence just 724 as compared to moving violation. It is stated that most of the police arrests were execute due to moving violations. The traffic stops outcomes also examined in which majority of the outcomes user traffic stops are written warning and citation over the 1/3 of the results of the stop.

It is invested that the Asian, Black, and Hispanic drivers are arrested at a high rate than white drivers. It is also invested that non-white drivers are arrested due to moving violation and equipment but most of the white drivers are arrested for other reasons. On the other hand, Hispanic and Black drivers are arrested at a high rate as compared to white drivers. Black driverâ€™s citation rates are also very high across the board than others. Asian citation rates are highly varying and arrest rates are lower. Results are looks possibly race-wise bias across violation types.
